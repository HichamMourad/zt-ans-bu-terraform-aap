This optional challenge introduces the fundamental concepts of Terraform. You will use basic Terraform commands to deploy, modify, and destroy cloud infrastructure in AWS.

---

== Overview

Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to define, build, and manage infrastructure resources in a declarative way. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with its core workflow.

ðŸ‘‹ *Welcome!*

*Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes*

.In this challenge, you will learn:
* Basic Terraform commands like `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.
* How to use Terraform to deploy simple cloud infrastructure in AWS.

NOTE: You can perform the following steps in the `TERMINAL` or within the `VSCODE` tab. This guide uses the `TERMINAL`, but the commands are identical for both.

---

== Task 1: Initialize the Project

The first step in any Terraform project is initialization. This process downloads the necessary provider plugins that your configuration requires.

. **Navigate to the exercise directory.**
+
**Open** the `TERMINAL` tab and **change** to the `1.Terraform_Basics` folder.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/1.Terraform_Basics
----

. **Examine the configuration file.**
+
A `main.tf` file has been created for you. **View** its contents.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat main.tf
----
+
[source,terraform]
----
# Use AWS provider for Terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "basic_rhel" {
  ami           = "ami-0005e0cfe09cc9050"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
----
+
This simple configuration declares two main blocks:
+
* `provider "aws"`: Tells Terraform you intend to work with resources in Amazon Web Services.
* `resource "aws_instance" ...`: Declares a resource to be createdâ€”in this case, an EC2 instance using a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.

. **Initialize Terraform.**
+
**Run** the `terraform init` command in your terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----
+
Terraform will download the AWS provider and create a `.terraform` directory to store its files and a `.terraform.lock.hcl` file to lock the provider versions.

---

== Task 2: Plan and Apply the Infrastructure

Once initialized, you can create an execution plan and apply it to build the infrastructure.

. **Create an execution plan.**
+
The `terraform plan` command lets you preview the changes Terraform will make without actually applying them. The `-out` flag saves the plan to a file.
+
**Run** the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform plan -out myMagicalInstance
----
+
The output shows all the resources that will be added (`+`), changed (`~`), or destroyed (`-`).

. **Apply the plan.**
+
Now, **execute** the plan to create the resources in AWS.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform apply myMagicalInstance
----
+
Terraform will create the EC2 instance as defined in your configuration.

. **Verify the instance creation.**
+
You can **use** the AWS CLI to confirm the instance is running and get its ID.
+
[source,bash]
----
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]" --output table --region "us-east-1"
----
+

+
NOTE: You may see more than one instance if you have completed other challenges in this lab.

. **Inspect the state file.**
+
Terraform records the resources it manages in a state file named `terraform.tfstate`. **Examine** this file to see detailed information about the infrastructure you just provisioned.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat terraform.tfstate
----

TIP: You can also log in to the `AWS Console` using the tab at the top of the lab to visually confirm that the new EC2 instance has been created.

---

== Task 3: Modify the Infrastructure

Making changes is a core part of the IaC lifecycle. Let's add a security group to the project.

. **Edit the configuration file.**
+
**Open** `main.tf` with a text editor like `vim` and **add** the following `aws_security_group` resource block to the file.
+
[source,bash]
----
vim main.tf
----
+
[source,terraform]
----
resource "aws_security_group" "terraform_group" {
  name = "myMagicalSecGroup"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
----

. **Plan and apply the changes.**
+
Just as before, **create** a new plan to see the intended changes and then **apply** it.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform plan -out myMagicalInstance
----
+
The plan summary will show `1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.`.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform apply myMagicalInstance
----
+
Terraform will create and associate the new security group.

TIP: You can log back into the `AWS Console` to see the new security group and its ingress/egress rules.

---

== Task 4: Destroy the Infrastructure

Terraform makes it just as easy to tear down resources as it does to create them.

. **Run the destroy command.**
+
Since these resources are no longer needed, **run** `terraform destroy`. Terraform uses the state file as a source of truth to identify and remove all managed resources.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform destroy
----
+
Terraform will ask for confirmation. **Type** `yes` and **press Enter** to proceed.

. **Confirm the destruction.**
+
You will see output confirming that the EC2 instance and the security group have been destroyed.
+

TIP: For final validation, you can check the `AWS Console` to see that the resources have been deleted.

---

== Conclusion

This concludes the optional Terraform Basics challenge. You have successfully used the core Terraform workflow to initialize a project, create a plan, apply changes to build and modify cloud resources, and finally destroy them.
