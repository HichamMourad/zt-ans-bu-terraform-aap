== Overview

Terraform is a powerful tool for deploying cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It allows us to define infrastructure and then build, change, and destroy these resources systematically.

While Terraform is excellent for infrastructure deployment, adding Ansible to the mix brings Configuration as Code (CaC) to the party, adding significant value to your automation journey!

== Lab Objectives

Welcome to the `Terraform and Ansible Automation Platform` lab. In the following challenges and tasks, we will guide you through using Ansible Automation Platform and Terraform together to trigger Terraform infrastructure creation from a central automation tool (Ansible Automation Platform).

By the end of this lab, you will learn:

* How to configure the Terraform Backend Credential in Ansible Automation Platform
* How to configure the Terraform Inventory
* How to create Ansible job templates and run them to create AWS resources using Terraform
* How to integrate Terraform with Ansible Automation Platform for seamless infrastructure management

'''

== Task 1: Configure the Terraform Backend Credential in Ansible Automation Platform

=== Understanding the Terraform Backend Credential Type

The `Terraform Backend Credential Type` enables secure storage of configuration for any remote Terraform backend in Ansible Automation Platform. This allows Ansible Automation Platform to access the Terraform State File wherever you choose to store it.

In this lab, you will store the Terraform State File on an AWS S3 storage bucket.

=== Step 1: Login to AWS and Retrieve the S3 Bucket Name

Before configuring the `Terraform Backend Credential` in Ansible Automation Platform, we need to identify the S3 bucket name where the Terraform state files will be stored.

**1.** Click on the `AWS Console` tab at the top of the lab.

**2.** Note your temporary AWS account details (you'll need these now and later).

[.text-center]
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awsconsole.png?raw=true[AWS Console Tab,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

**3.** Launch the AWS console from the `Account ID` launch link.

**4.** Login with the provided AWS credentials.

[.text-center]
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awslogin.png?raw=true[AWS Login,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

**5.** Upon login to AWS, type `S3` in the search field and select the S3 service.

**6.** In the S3 service, you will see the existing S3 storage bucket that we've already created for you.

**7.** Make note of the bucket name - it will start with `aap-tf-bucket-###aLongListofCharacters###`.

[TIP]
====
We will need this bucket name shortly for the backend configuration.
====

image:https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awss3name.png?raw=true[S3 Bucket Name,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

=== Step 2: Create the Terraform Backend Credential in Ansible Automation Platform

**1.** Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of the lab.

**2.** Log in using the following credentials:
   * *Username:* `admin`
   * *Password:* `ansible123!`

[NOTE]
====
Credentials are utilized for authentication when launching jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from version control systems.

In this lab, we have created several different credentials:

* `AWS_Credential` - AWS credential for performing actions on AWS cloud (creating VPCs, instances, etc.)
* `SSH Controller Credentials` - SSH key for the Ansible Automation Platform
====

**3.** Navigate to credentials by expanding the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.

**4.** Go to `Automation Execution` → `Infrastructure` → `Credentials`.

**5.** Click on the `Credentials` link and examine the pre-configured credentials.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The keys are encrypted, so no one (not even administrators) can see the keys once placed in Ansible Automation Platform as a credential.
====

**6.** Click on `+ Create credential`.

**7.** Configure the credential with the following details:
   * *Name:* `Terraform Backend Credential`
   * *Credential Type:* `Terraform backend configuration` (from dropdown)

**8.** In the `Backend configuration` section, enter the following details (you MUST update lines 1, 2, 4, and 5 with your specific details):

[source,hcl]
----
bucket = "aap-tf-bucket-ALONG-LISTOF-CHARACTERS-CHANGE-ME"
key = "YOURNAME/tfstatefile"
region = "us-east-1"
access_key = "YOUR-LAB-awsaccesskey-CHANGE-ME"
secret_key = "YOUR-LAB-awssecretkey-CHANGE-ME"
----

[.text-center]
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfbackendcred.png?raw=true[Terraform Backend Credential,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

[WARNING]
====
Before clicking `Create credential`, ensure your configuration looks SIMILAR to the following example BUT WITH YOUR SPECIFIC AWS ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:

[source,hcl]
----
bucket = "aap-tf-bucket-cfe5d5cb-b3fa-5555-555c-blahblahblah"
key = "johnsmith/tfstatefile"
region = "us-east-1"
access_key = "AKBCDEBLAHBLAHBLAH"
secret_key = "Oz8vqJsY6zFFFq83xblahblahblahblahblah"
----
====

**9.** Click on `Create credential` to save the credential.

'''

== Task 2: Configure Terraform Inventory

=== Understanding Terraform Inventory in Ansible Automation Platform

An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which automation jobs may be launched. You can source your inventory data from external sources and cloud providers. In this case, we will be sourcing our data from Terraform, which is why we'll create a Terraform Inventory Source.

=== Step 1: Create the Terraform Inventory Source

**1.** Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of the lab (if not already there).

**2.** Navigate to inventories by expanding the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.

**3.** Go to `Automation Execution` → `Infrastructure` → `Inventories`.

**4.** Notice the inventory we've created for you called `Terraform Inventory`.

[.text-center]
image:https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventory1.png?raw=true[Terraform Inventory,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

[NOTE]
====
If the inventory update doesn't succeed, please re-check and update the Terraform Backend Credential configuration.
====

'''

== Task 3: Create a Job Template for Terraform AWS Provider

In this task, we will create an Ansible Job Template that will kick off a Terraform project. The Terraform project will leverage the AWS provider to create an EC2 instance in your AWS cloud account.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that you can also perform this same process with Azure and Google Cloud providers.
====

=== Step 1: Create and Launch the Job Template

**1.** Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of the lab (if not already there).

**2.** Navigate to templates by expanding the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.

**3.** Go to `Automation Execution` → `Templates`.

**4.** Click on `+ Create Template`.

[.text-center]

[NOTE]
====
The inventory updates can occur automatically, but we performed this manually so you could see the before and after results in the `Hosts` tab of the `Terraform Inventory`.
====

=== Task 3 Summary

In this task, you created an AAP Job Template that kicks off a Terraform Project. The Terraform Project uses the Terraform Provider for AWS to trigger the creation of AWS resources. You then synchronized the inventory source that pulled in the inventory created by Terraform. This demonstrates an excellent way to trigger Terraform Projects from Ansible Automation Platform - **A BETTER TOGETHER STORY!**

=== The Terraform Project Configuration

Here's the Terraform main.tf project file that was launched using Ansible Automation Platform:

[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.2.0"
    }
  }
  backend "s3" {}
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Fetch the default VPC
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-1" {
  ami           = "ami-0005e0cfe09cc9050"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-1"
  }
}
----

'''

== Task 4: Create a Job Template for Terraform AWS & AAP Providers

In this task, we will create an Ansible Job Template that kicks off a Terraform project using both AWS and Ansible Automation Platform providers. **The Terraform project will create AWS resources and leverage the Ansible Automation Platform provider to push the Terraform inventory (EC2 hosts) directly into the Ansible Automation Platform inventory.**

[NOTE]
====
Please note that you can also perform this with Azure and Google Cloud providers in the same way as demonstrated here with AWS.
====

=== Step 1: Create and Launch the Job Template

**1.** Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of the lab (if not already there).

**2.** Navigate to templates by expanding the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.

**3.** Go to `Automation Execution` → `Templates`.

**4.** Click on `+ Create Template`, then scroll down and click `Create job template`.

=== Task 4 Summary

In this task, you created an AAP Job Template that kicks off a Terraform Project using the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform to create AWS resources. Terraform (via the Terraform Provider for AAP) then automatically pushed the created resources into the Ansible Automation Platform Inventory.

The Terraform Provider for AAP is typically used at the Terraform command line by Terraform users. Here you saw how to use it within Ansible Automation Platform. The Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform can also trigger Ansible Automation Platform Job Templates, further enhancing the **BETTER TOGETHER STORY** and providing more options and choices for automators and infrastructure operators!

=== The Terraform Project Configuration

Here's the Terraform main.tf project file that was launched using Ansible Automation Platform:

[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.2.0"
    }

    aap = {
      source = "ansible/aap"
    }
  }
  backend "s3" {}
}

'''

== Challenge: Create a Terraform-enabled Execution Environment

=== Challenge Overview

In this challenge, you will create an Execution Environment that will enable Terraform usage in Ansible Automation Platform.

[.lab-info]
--
*Estimated time to complete:* 30 minutes
--

=== What is an Execution Environment?

All automation in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform runs on container images called automation execution environments. Automation execution environments create a common language for communicating automation dependencies and offer a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.

In the previous tasks, an Execution Environment called `Terraform Execution Environment` was already created for you.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use Terraform in YOUR Ansible Automation Platform environment, you must create an Execution Environment that includes the Cloud Terraform collection, the Terraform binary, other cloud collections, and other dependencies. This is why you will learn how to create an Execution Environment.
====

The tool needed to create an `execution environment` is called `ansible-builder`.

=== Challenge Objectives

By the end of this challenge, you will learn:

* How to create the necessary configuration files needed to create an execution environment
* How to create the execution environment container image using the `ansible-builder` tool  
* How to add the new execution environment to Ansible Automation Platform

=== Execution Environments Overview

*To run Terraform commands from within Ansible Automation Platform, you will need to create an execution environment that contains the Terraform binary and the Red Hat certified collection for Terraform. This is easy to do using https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/latest/html/creating_and_using_execution_environments/assembly-using-builder[ansible-builder].*

In this challenge, you will create an execution environment containing everything you need to run Terraform from the Ansible Automation Platform.

[NOTE]
====
You can perform the following steps at the TERMINAL or in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). In VSCode, you can open a terminal prompt. Choose either the `TERMINAL` tab or the `VSCODE` tab from the top of the lab screen. We will walk through the steps using the `TERMINAL`, but please feel free to use the `VSCODE` tab if you are more comfortable there!
====

'''

== Task A: Create the Configuration Files for the Execution Environment

To create an execution environment with `ansible-builder`, we need an execution environment definition file. The file name will be `execution-environment.yml`.

=== Step 1: Navigate to the Working Directory  

**1.** Go to the `TERMINAL` tab at the top of the lab to open the terminal prompt.

**2.** You will be in the `/home/rhel` folder by default.

**3.** Change to the folder named `/home/rhel/terraform-ee`:

[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/terraform-ee
----

**4.** Note that two empty files already exist in this folder: `execution-environment.yml` and `requirements.yml`.

=== Step 2: Create the Execution Environment Definition File

**1.** Modify the `execution-environment.yml` file using `vi`, `vim`, or `nano`:

[source,bash]
----
vim execution-environment.yml
----

**2.** Paste the following contents into the file:

[source,yaml]
----
---
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel8:latest

dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf

additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    - RUN $PYCMD -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
  append_base:
    - RUN curl "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.12.2/terraform_1.12.2_linux_amd64.zip" -o "/terraform.zip"
    - RUN unzip /terraform.zip -d /terraform
    - RUN mv /terraform/terraform /bin
----

This file defines the rules `ansible-builder` should use to create the execution environment container, including:

* **version:** The version of ansible-builder to use
* **images:** Here you define the base image to use for the container. *You are using the `ee-minimal-rhel8:latest` base image for the build process*
* **dependencies:** In this section, you can declare dependencies for optionally galaxy (ansible collections), python, and other system dependencies. Notice this section includes a statement `galaxy: requirements.yml` - this is the file used to define dependent collections found on Ansible Galaxy to be included within the Execution Environment being built
* **additional_build_steps:** Here we can list commands to be inserted into the Dockerfile/Containerfile to be executed. In this example, we are downloading and installing Terraform because the Terraform binary is needed for Ansible Automation Platform for playbook execution, specifically playbooks that trigger Terraform.
  - `prepend_base` includes commands to be used *before* the main build steps
  - `append_base` includes commands to be used *after* the main build steps

=== Step 3: Create the Requirements File

**1.** Modify the file called `requirements.yml`:

[source,bash]
----
vim requirements.yml
----

**2.** Paste the following contents into the file:

[source,yaml]
----
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
  - name: cloud.terraform
  - name: google.cloud
----

This file defines the Ansible content collections you want to include in your execution environment:

* Include the `amazon.aws`, `cloud.terraform`, and `google.cloud` collections
* This will allow Ansible playbooks to perform automation on cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP using Terraform and Ansible Automation Platform
* If additional collections are desired, you would include them in the `requirements.yml` file as well

'''

== Task B: Run ansible-builder

Now you will run `ansible-builder` to build the execution environment container.

=== Step 1: Build the Execution Environment

**1.** From the terminal prompt, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-builder build -v 3 --tag terraform-ee
----

**2.** This will build the container image tagged with `terraform-ee`.

**3.** This process will take a few minutes, and you should see output similar to the following:

[.text-center]
image:https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/eesuccess.png?raw=true[Execution Environment Build Success,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

=== Step 2: Verify the Image Creation

**1.** To see the newly created image, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
podman images
----

**2.** This image was built locally and is now available for use.

[TIP]
====
At this point, you would typically push the container image to a registry such as `Quay`, `Dockerhub`, or your own `Private Automation Hub`. If you have a Quay or Dockerhub account already, feel free to create a repository, push the image as you normally would, and use it in the following steps. *Otherwise, we have a pre-existing image you can use.*
====

=== Example Commands for Registry Push

If you want to push to a registry like Quay.io, here are example commands:

[source,bash]
----
podman tag localhost/terraform-ee quay.io/[username]/terraform-ee
podman login --username [username] --password [mypassword] quay.io  
podman push quay.io/[username]/terraform-ee
----

'''

== Task C: Add the Terraform Execution Environment to Ansible Automation Platform

Now you will add an execution environment to Ansible Automation Platform.

=== Step 1: Access Ansible Automation Platform

**1.** Click on the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab at the top of the lab (if not already there).

**2.** Log in using the following credentials:
   * *Username:* `admin`
   * *Password:* `ansible123!`

=== Step 2: Navigate to Execution Environments

**1.** Expand the `Automation Execution` menu on the left.

**2.** Navigate to `Automation Execution` → `Infrastructure` → `Execution Environments`.

=== Step 3: Create the New Execution Environment

**1.** Click on `+ Create execution environment`.

**2.** Enter the following information:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Field | Value

| Name
| myTerraform EE

| Image  
| quay.io/acme_corp/terraform_ee

| Pull
| Only pull the image if not present before running

| Registry credential
| Quay Registry Credential
|===

[NOTE]
====
Since this image on Quay.io is public, you don't need to create a Registry credential.
====

**3.** Click on `Create execution environment` to save this new Execution Environment.

[TIP]
====
Yes, we're using the same image we already have, but remember, this is just to demonstrate how you would add your own created Execution Environment to Ansible Automation Platform.
====

[.text-center]
image:https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/create-ee.png?raw=true[Create Execution Environment,800,align="center",style="border: 2px solid black"]

**4.** This Execution Environment is now available for use in Ansible Automation Platform.

=== Challenge Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully:

✅ Created the necessary configuration files for an execution environment
✅ Built a custom execution environment using `ansible-builder`
✅ Added the new execution environment to Ansible Automation Platform

You now have the knowledge and skills to create custom execution environments tailored to your specific automation needs, including Terraform integration with Ansible Automation Platform.
